Bombay Band Management System

A system for managing many of the pickier aspects of running a band.  It should eventually support repertoire,
setlist, membership and calendar management for multiple bands within a single database.

But, really, it's mostly about me learning more Javascript and Node.js stuff.

ToDo:
- Ability to attach links to video/audio on songs.

- The setlist management UI is non-existant.
- The calendar handler is non-existant.
- Authentication through Google.
- Integration of Google Calendars.
- Simplify some of the UI.
  - Use drag and drop.
  - Allow CSV upload.
  - "Bulk" adds.
